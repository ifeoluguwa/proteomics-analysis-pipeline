# Proteomics Analysis Pipeline

Advanced R pipeline for large-scale proteomics data analysis with batch correction, cell-type validation, and pathway enrichment.

## Overview

This pipeline analyzes mass spectrometry proteomics data from human iPSC-derived neurons and microglia (4,000+ proteins per dataset). Developed for QR2 inhibition studies in Alzheimer's disease research.

### Key Features
- **Batch correction** using ComBat, SVA, and manual approaches
- **Cell-type marker validation** with expression heatmaps
- **Advanced protein ID mapping** (85-95% success rate)
- **Pathway enrichment analysis** (GO terms, KEGG pathways)
- **Publication-quality visualizations** (300 DPI PNG/PDF)
- **Automated HTML reports** with interactive navigation

## Pipeline Components

### 1. Batch Correction (`01_batch_correction.R`)
- Removes technical variation while preserving biological signal
- Multiple methods: ComBat, Standard SVA+Limma, Manual SVA
- Automated quality control with PCA visualization
- Comprehensive protein tracking and validation

### 2. Cell Type Validation (`02_cell_type_validation.R`)
- Validates cellular identity using known markers
- **Microglia**: IBA-1, TMEM119, P2Y12, CD68, CX3CR1
- **Neurons**: MAP2, TUBB3, SYN1, NCAM1, synaptic proteins
- Fold-change heatmaps showing cell-type specificity

### 3. Pathway Analysis (`03_pathway_analysis.R`)
- Gene Ontology enrichment (Biological Process, Molecular Function, Cellular Component)
- KEGG pathway analysis with metabolic pathway focus
- Multi-threshold analysis (log2FC > 1.0 and > 0.8)
- Cell-type comparative analysis

## Technical Highlights

**Protein Mapping Strategy**: 5-stage approach using clusterProfiler, AnnotationDbi, biomaRt, with fuzzy matching and cell-type specific patterns

**Scale**: 4,000+ proteins, multiple conditions, batch correction across technical replicates

**Output**: CSV results, publication-ready plots, interactive HTML reports, comprehensive documentation

## Installation

```r
# Bioconductor packages
BiocManager::install(c("clusterProfiler", "org.Hs.eg.db", "sva", "limma"))

# CRAN packages  
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "pheatmap", "writexl"))

## Usage
# Run complete analysis
results <- run_qr2_pathway_analysis(
    microglia_dir = "path/to/microglia/data",
    neuron_dir = "path/to/neuron/data"

## Research Application
# QR2 Inhibition Study: Investigating quinone reductase 2 inhibition as therapeutic target
# Metabolic pathway enrichment in both cell types
# Cell-type specific responses to treatment

## Key Results Example
Microglia: Strong enrichment in DNA replication and repair processes
Neurons: enrichment of lipid and complex carbohydrate metabolism pathways 
Comparative: Differential metabolic responses between cell types
